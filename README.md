# TMS Express üó£
TMS Express generates bitstreams for the TMS5220 Voice Synthesis Processor.

The TMS5220 hardware and its software analogues (i.e. Arduino Talkie) alike may be driven by the output of TMS Express.
The program accepts audio files in a variety of formats, applies linear predictive coding (LPC) to compress the data, 
and outputs either an ASCII bitstream or C header with the encoded data.

Compared to existing encoders, TMS Express has the following advantages:
- Implements the original Levinson-Durbin recursion to determine LPC coefficients
- Supports repeat frames for enhanced audio compression
- Automatically downsamples and mixes audio files of any format
- Performs batch encoding of multiple files

# Installation
## Install via Homebrew üç∫
Homebrew is the preferred installation method on macOS and Linux.

```shell
$ brew tap tornupnegatives/tmsexpress && brew install tms-express
```

## Compile from Source
### Dependencies
TMS Express is built using CMake and dynamically links against `libsndfile` and `libsamplerate`. These libraries must
be present not only on the build system, but also on the target machine.

The program also takes advantage of the `CLI11` library to provide a command-line interface, and the `googletest` 
framework for unit testing. However, CMake will automatically install local copies of both during the build sequence.

### Compilation
```shell
$ cmake -B build
$ cd build && make -j
```

## Usage
## The Encode Command
The `encode` command accepts audio file(s) and a variety of parameters which affect how they are processed, analyzed,
and formatted for output. TMS Express automatically detects when the input path is a directory and performs a batch job.

```shell
$ tmsexpress encode [OPTIONS] input output
```

### Explanation of Options
- `window`: Speech data is separated into small windows/segments, each of which are analyzed individually. This is because small enough segments of speech data are roughly periodic and their behavior may be generalized. An ideal window width is between 22.5-25 ms
  - Values above and below the recommendation will artificially speed up and slow down speech, respectively
- `highpass` and `lowpass`: Speech data occupies a relatively small frequency band compared to what digital audio files are capable of representing. Filtering out unnecessary frequencies may lead to more accurated LPC analysis
  - Lowering the highpass filter cutoff will improve the bass response of the audio
  - Adjusting the lowpass cutoff may have minor effects of pitch estimation
- `alpha`: While the pitch of speech is characterized by the lower frequency band, LPC algorithms which characterize the upper vocal tract benefit from an exaggeration of high frequency data. A pre-emphasis filter will exaggerate this part of the spectrum and lead to crisper, more accurate synthesis
- `format`: ASCII format is ideal for testing and visualization of single files. The C and Arduino format produce C headers for use with TMS5220 emulations
- `no-stop-frame`: An explicit stop frame signals to the TMS5220 that the Speak External command has finished executing
- `gain`: Increases the gain of the synthesized signal by adjusting the index of the coding table element. Gain offsets greater than the max size of the coding table will hit the ceiling
- `max-voiced-gain`: Specifies the maximum gain (dB) of the output signal for voiced frames (vowels)
- `max-unvoiced-gain`: Specifies the maximum gain (dB) of the output signal for unvoiced frames (consonants)
  - Ensuring that this value hovers around `0.8 * max-voiced-gain` will result in the most accurate synthesis of consonant sounds
- `use-repeat-frames`: Detect repeat frames to reduce the size of the bitstream
- `max-frq`: Specifies the maximum representable pitch frequency of the output signal
- `min-frq`: Specifies the minimum representable pitch frequency of the output signal
